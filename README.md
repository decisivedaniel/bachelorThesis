rustup install of c2rust
Line count is not as useful, look into statement count (statement counter?)
Try simpler program
See if my sample program is not proper
Look into llm driven functions that can return better code
- SACTOR
- c2saferrust
with local run llm

extern c, shows file by file transfer for the integration
- just functions and allows c functions to call into rust
- once all code is converted then the actual translation can start

Ignore the c2rust 
Translate multiple c programs into rust
identify the changes needed and refactoring
